## Introduction
``mimic++`` is a c++20 mocking framework, which aims to offer a very natural end expressive syntax, without constantly resorting to macros.
To be honest, macros cannot be completely avoided, but they can at least be reduced to a very minimum.

The one thing, that this framework does different than all other (or at least all I am aware of) mocking framework is, that mock objects explicitly are function objects,
thus directly callable. It's simple and straight forward.

As I'm mainly working on template or functional-style code, I wanted something simpler than always creating explicit mock types for the simplest of use cases.
So, ``mimicpp::Mock`` objects can directly used as functional objects, but they can also be used as member objects and thus serve as actual member functions.
If you are curious, have a look at the documentation or directly into the examples.

### Special Acknowledgement
This framework is highly inspired by the well known [trompeloeil](https://github.com/rollbear/trompeloeil), which I have used myself for several years now.
It's definitly not bad, but sometimwes feels a little bit dated and some macros do not play very well with formatting tools and the like.
If you need a pre-c++20 mocking-framework, you should definitly give it a try.

Fun fact: ``mimic++`` uses ``trompeloeil`` for it's own test suite :D
