     *
     * In essence, it behaves similarly to manually attaching expectations via `expect::in_sequence` to a sequence.
     * The primary distinction is that if an expectation is not satisfied,
     * this type will report the first unfulfilled expectation.
     * In contrast, when expectations are manually constructed as `ScopedExpectation`,
     * the last created expectation (due to the stackâ€™s order) would typically be reported.
     *
     * Nevertheless, all standard sequence rules also apply.
